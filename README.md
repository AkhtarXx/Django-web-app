## Contribution
**ðŸ”± Developed by Jourdan.**

Since I didn't really enroll in this course, this project is only used for self-learning. Some of this project requirements are meaningless and time-consuming for me, so I have not implemented (or just leave the interface) yet.

**Due to the limited time, I did not clean up and refractor the code. I would be glad if someone can further improve this project.**
